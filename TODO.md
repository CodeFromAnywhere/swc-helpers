# TODO

Cleanup os/packages:

text-or-binary
marked-util
schema-util --> schema-helpers
swc-util --> swc-helpers

Go over swc-helpers and find the useful functions for a potential openapi

Check if it runs on vercel and make a composable thing that works with the github files checker.

Make swc-util able to generate an openapi for any functional package.

remove all un-needed wrapping of things

makeRelative is nothing

generateRandomString is just half of the first line

Some are missing randomly... report when it can't be found

See https://claude.ai/chat/b087059f-64b5-434b-9423-f974ffd742db and try to make something like this but without too much LLM work. The ability to analyze code and turn it into an openapi spec, even if it's not entirely functional, is truly useful for refactors.
