# TODO

Cleanup os/packages:

text-or-binary
marked-util
schema-util --> schema-helpers
swc-util --> swc-helpers

Go over swc-helpers and find the useful functions for a potential openapi

Check if it runs on vercel and make a composable thing that works with the github files checker.

Make swc-util able to generate an openapi for any functional package.

remove all un-needed wrapping of things

makeRelative is nothing

generateRandomString is just half of the first line

Some are missing randomly... report when it can't be found
